        <h2>Problem Statement: Time Management App for Computer Science Students</h2>
        <p>
            Computer science students at universities often face challenges in time management when dealing with intensive programming projects and theoretical assignments. They need a time management app that helps plan short-term and long-term academic tasks and provides custom reminders and progress tracking. This app should be simple to use, seamlessly integrating with their daily study routines, thus helping them improve learning efficiency, reduce procrastination, and complete high-quality academic tasks within strict deadlines.
