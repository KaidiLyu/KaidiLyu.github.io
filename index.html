                <a href="images/problem-statement.jpg">Problem Statement: Time Management App for Computer Science
                    Students</a>
            </h2>
            <p>
                Computer science students at universities often face challenges in time management when dealing with
                intensive programming projects and theoretical assignments.
                They need a time management app that helps plan both short-term and long-term academic tasks, and
                provides custom reminders and progress tracking.
                This app should be simple to use, seamlessly integrating with their daily study routines,
                thus helping them improve learning efficiency, reduce procrastination, and complete academic tasks with
                high quality within strict deadlines.

                It distinguishes between different categories of information through color coding and thematic grouping,
                aiming to identify key themes, trends and potential solutions within a project or study.
                Charts facilitate in-depth discussion and strategic planning through logical distribution and related
                grouping, providing us with clear direction and action guide.

                <h2>Team Personas: Alex Johnson </h2>
            </a>
            <p>
                Alex Johnson, a 22-year-old Senior College Student and Part-time Software Development Intern from
                Austin, Texas, embraces the philosophy to "Stay hungry, stay foolish." - Steve Jobs.
                He balances a busy schedule by going for a run every morning and learning new programming languages in
                his spare moments.
                His comfort with technology spans from the internet to mobile apps, and he values innovation,
                efficiency, and continuous learning.
                Alex needs an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) with high contrast and code syntax highlighting.
                He wants his academic and work projects to sync automatically to a personal digital calendar.
                Despite his tech-savviness, Alex fears security issues due to code vulnerabilities and struggles to keep
                up with rapid technological changes.

                <h2>Team Storyboards: Time Management App Design</h2>
            </a>
            <p>
                In this storyboard, we explore a day in the life of Chris, a computer science major struggling with
                managing deadlines for his projects and assignments. The scenario begins with Chris overwhelmed by his
                schedule, missing deadlines, and feeling stressed. The turning point comes with the introduction of our
                Time Management App, specifically designed for students like him. It visualizes his schedule, suggests
                work blocks for projects, and sets smart reminders. The storyboard concludes with Chris successfully
                managing his tasks, highlighting the app's impact on improving his academic life and reducing stress.
